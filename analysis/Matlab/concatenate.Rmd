## Overview

This is an R Markdown document that can be dropped one level up from a folder with individual csv files you want to concatenate (bind by rows) for later analysis.

### Load individual csvs

```{r concatenate, warning=FALSE}

library(gtools)

setwd("raw") #this is the folder name that contains the individual csvs
filenames <- list.files(full.names=TRUE) #lists each file in the folder

data <- data.frame()

All <- lapply(filenames,function(i){
  temp <- read.csv(i)
  temp$identifier <- i
  data <- smartbind(data, temp)
}) #function that reads the csv for all files listed in 'filenames'

data <- do.call(smartbind, All) #use function and bind the read csv files be row into a large data frame

```

### Save combined data frame

```{r save_csv}


write.csv(data,"MAE-ATTN-100.csv", row.names=FALSE) #save the large data frame as its own csv file


```
